A simple embedded EtherCAT slave device using a xMega microcontroller developed at the [Dynamic Robotics Lab](http://mime.oregonstate.edu/research/drl/) at OSU.  The device allows for base functionality of the EtherCAT slave protocol and breaks out the remaining I/O of the xMega for convenient prototyping or daughter boards.
