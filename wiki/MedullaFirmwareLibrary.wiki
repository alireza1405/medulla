#summary This page discusses the firmware library available in the SVN.

= Introduction =

The Medulla Firmware Library is written to help users develop firmware for the ATxmega128a1 on the medulla board. In particular the library focuses on providing firmware drivers to interface with robotics hardware.

= Implementation Guidelines =

In most cases program execution speed will be very important in programs using the Medulla Firmware Library. Unless absolutely necessarily library functions should not block program execution. Additionally, wherever possible the interrupts, hardware peripherals, DMA, and event system in the XMega should be used. This will ensure a minimal impact on firmware performance, and make the most out of the XMega hardware.

= Hardware Drivers =

The following is an initial list of drivers that will be implemented in the Medulla Firmware Library:
  * *XMega system clock*
    This driver simplifies configuring the clock systems on the medulla.
  * *Digital IO driver*
    The DIO driver is a set of macros to simplify the use of the XMega digital IO. It provides simple interfaces for configuring IO direction and pull-up resistors. It also makes it easy to configure pin change interrupts on any DIO pin.
  * *ADC Driver*
    The ADC driver provides functions to control the internal ADCs on the XMega.
  * *Biss-C encoder driver*
    This driver implements the BISS-C interface to read encoders on any of XMega's SPI ports.
  * *SSI encoder driver*
    The SSI encoder driver implements the SSI protocol on an SPI port to read data from an encoder.
